A fun side-project that I built for generating AI art for Minecraft. You can generate art such as Server logos.

## Minecraftmagic.com
Minecraftmagic was originally developed as a project to demonstrate how inexpensive AI can be. 

The project aim was to showcase the potential for server owners to use AI-powered tools to create assets like logos and banners cost-effectively. 

The focus later shifted towards demonstrating Laravel best practices through a concrete implementation.

Minecraftmagic is a work in progress, but I hope that you find it useful for your learning.

A fun side-project that I built for generating Minecraft AI-Art such as Server logos using DALL-E 3.

## Minecraftmagic.com

Minecraftmagic was originally developed as a side-project to get Minecraft server owners to use AI to generate resources that they could use for their server. E.g. server logos or banners. I didn't see much use of this platform so decided to pivot more towards a concrete implementation of how you could use Laravel with best practices.

Minecraftmagic is a work in progress but I hope that you find it useful for your learning.

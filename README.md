A fun side-project that I built for generating Minecraft AI-Art. You can generate Art such as Server logos - as shown above. Use DALL-E-3 AI technology.

## Minecraftmagic.com
Minecraftmagic was originally developed as a side-project to demonstrate how inexpensive AI can generate art resources for Minecraft servers. 
The project aimed to showcase the potential for server owners to use AI-powered tools to create assets like logos and banners cost-effectively. 

The focus later shifted towards demonstrating Laravel best practices through a concrete implementation.

Minecraftmagic is a work in progress, but I hope that you find it useful for your learning.
